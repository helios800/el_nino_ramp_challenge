This repo is my contribution to the X-datacamp 2023/2024, aimed at creating a new challenge on the RAMP platform. 
We will here try to build a regression model for time serie analysis, the El Nino time serie. 
We tried to beat a simple ARMA model, classical for time serie analysis, using a LSTM model. 

See the starting_kit.ipynb for all the informations on the challenge.
